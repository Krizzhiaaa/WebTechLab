            <div id="burnham"><h2>Burnham Park</h2></div>
            <p>Burnham park is the number 1(in our opinion) tourist place here in Baguio City where tourist sit in the grass; they eat and spend time together with their family and relatives. Kids and those who are kids at heart are also riding bikes there. Rental of bikes there are "want to sawa"  &mdash; which means you can ride it without any time limit &mdash; every weekdays but in weekends it has time limit because there are alot of people who are there every weekend. People also ride mini boats with different sizes and design. Their rental are also the same as the bikes. </p>
